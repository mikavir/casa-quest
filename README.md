**Casa Quest: Your Ultimate House-Hunting Adventure Begins Here!**

Introducing a responsive web app for house-hunters to efficiently organize and track properties. Users can create personalized accounts, curate dashboards with viewed and upcoming houses, and utilize built-in tools for comparing properties, streamlining the house-hunting process.

## UX

The inspiration for this idea came from my recent house-hunting experiences. Faced with a substantial amount of data for each property, I initially organized it manually using pen and paper. However, I soon realized the potential for a more efficient digital solution. This led me to develop this app, designed to streamline the process and enhance the user experience.

The target audience for this application is people who are actively purchasing homes, aiming to avoid any unforeseen surprises during the buying process. To enhance the user experience (UX) and design, I extensively researched various house-buying websites, including [RightMove](https://www.rightmove.co.uk/) and [Zoopla](https://www.zoopla.co.uk/). I found the design of [Mr and Mrs Clarke](https://www.mrandmrsclarke.com/) particularly inspiring. The goal of this project is to improve data organization and elevate the overall UX, making the house-hunting journey smoother and more enjoyable.

### Colour Scheme

Initially, these colours were selected to complement our logo. The shades of green and their corresponding hues were chosen for their association with tranquility and harmony. This makes them ideal for a website dedicated to house hunters searching for their perfect, peaceful home.

- Primary Color: rgb(250, 236, 217) - Hex: #FAECD9
- Secondary Color: rgb(88, 126, 123) - Hex: #587E7B
- Tertiary Color: rgb(253, 253, 253) - Hex: #FDFDFD
- Accent Color: rgb(23, 53, 59) - Hex: #17353B


I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/faecd9-587e7b-fdfdfd-17353b) to generate my colour palette.

![screenshot](documentation/casa-quest-colour-scheme.png)

As I developed my project, I discovered additional colors from the Materialize library that complemented my existing color scheme.

- #004d40 teal darken-4
- #00796b teal darken-2
- #ffe0b2 orange lighten-4

In total, these were the colours that made the website.

This was the colour taken from materialize web for cancel buttons: 

- #b71c1c red darken-4

### Typography

After researching other home buying websites and gathering ideas, I found significant inspiration in the design of the [Mr and Mrs Clarke](https://www.mrandmrsclarke.com/) website. The fonts used in the website have been inspired from the fonts that they have used.


- [Domine](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Domine) was used for the primary headers and titles.

- [Questrial](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Questrial) was used for all other secondary text.

- [Material Icons](https://fonts.google.com/icons?icon.set=Material+Icons) was used for icons from Materialize web.

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons were used throughout the site, such as the social media icons in the footer.

### Future Features

- Blog commmunity
    - As indicated in the database below, my initial plan was to incorporate a blog community as an additional feature for this project. However, integrating this feature at this stage would deviate from the minimum viable product (MVP) and consume valuable time that could be better utilized for rigorous testing and establishing a robust foundation for the project. Consequently, I made the challenging decision to prioritize the MVP and postpone the implementation of this feature for future consideration.
- Customised questions
    - A feature where users can create their own custom questions and inputs alongside the predetermined ones. This empowers users in their house-hunting journey, enabling them to include criteria that they prioritize personally. However, this feature is earmarked for future implementation, as it may necessitate a more robust database to efficiently store these user-generated questions.

## User Pathway
Using Lucidchart, I have illustrated the user pathways as shown below.
![screenshot](documentation/database/user-flow-pathway.png)


## Database Design

The data used for Casa Quest was inspired by a list of questions my partner and I compiled while viewing houses. Initially, we organized these questions into a comprehensive table shown below. 
The idea emerged to transform the table into a more digital, user-friendly format with organized data.

![screenshot](documentation/database/table-questions.png)


My project utilizes MongoDB, a non-relational database. Despite MongoDB's non-relational nature, there are established relations within this database, particularly with users owning a 'house' and each house 'having' associated information, as depicted in the ERD below crafted from [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/entityRelationshipDiagram.html). MongoDB's document-based data model offers a flexible schema design. This flexibility proves advantageous when handling entities like houses, accommodating varying attributes or additional information seamlessly without having to change to the entire schema.

```mermaid
erDiagram
    users {
        ObjectId id
        String Name
        String Username
        String Password
    }

    houses {
        ObjectId id
        String User_id
        String Address
        String Agency
        Integer Bedrooms
        Integer Bathroom
        String Property_Type
        Integer Price
        Boolean Chain_free
        String image_url
        String maps_url
        Boolean is_favourite
    }

    houseInformation {
        Object_id id
        Object_id House_id
        Character EPC
        Character Tax_Band
        String Flood_Risk
        String Dedicated_Parking
        String Internet_Speed
    }

    houseViewing {
        Object_id id
        Object_id House_id
        Boolean Other_offers
        String Sellers_situation
        String Windows
        String Neighbours
        String Facilities
        String Traffic
    }

    houseChecks {
        ObjectId id
        Object_id house_id
        Boolean Mould_damp
        String property_facing
        String Noise_pollution
        Boolean Boiler
        Boolean Attic
        Boolean Roof
        String Electric_ports
        Boolean Crack
        Boolean Damo
        Boolean Storage
    }

    users ||--o{ houses: owns
    houses ||--o{ houseInformation: has
    houses ||--o{ houseViewing: has
    houses ||--o{ houseChecks: has
```

My database is called **casa_quest**.

It contains 5 collections:

- **users**
- **house**
- **houseInformation**
- **houseChecks**
- **houseViewing**

Initially, I did have seven collections to accomodate for the feature of a blog. However I realized that the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) should focus on organizing house information rather than creating blog posts. This insight led me to eliminate the blog post feature and concentrate on achieving the core MVP. Below was the initial ERD of my project using [Lucid chart](www.lucidchart.com).

| `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY` | user's own value |
| `EMAIL_API` | user's own value |
| `MAPS_API` | user's own value |

Heroku needs three additional files in order to deploy properly.

- requirements.txt
- Procfile
- runtime.txt

You can install this project's **requirements** (where applicable) using:

- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

If you have your own packages that have been installed, then the requirements file needs updated using:

- `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`

The **Procfile** can be created with the following command:

- `echo web: python app.py > Procfile`
- *replace **app.py** with the name of your primary Flask app name; the one at the root-level*

The **runtime.txt** file needs to know which Python version you're using:
1. type: `python3 --version` in the terminal.
2. in the **runtime.txt** file, add your Python version:
	- `python-3.9.18`

For Heroku deployment, follow these steps to connect your own GitHub repository to the newly created app:

Either:

- Select **Automatic Deployment** from the Heroku app.

Or:

- In the Terminal/CLI, connect to Heroku using this command: `heroku login -i`
- Set the remote for Heroku: `heroku git:remote -a app_name` (replace *app_name* with your app name)
- After performing the standard Git `add`, `commit`, and `push` to GitHub, you can now type:
	- `git push heroku main`

The project should now be connected and deployed to Heroku!

### Obtaining EmailJS API 

1. Sign up for a [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/docs/) account in the EmailJS website.
2. Create an email service in your EmailJS dashboard.
3. Install EmailJS Library. You can do this by including the EmailJS script in your HTML file or by installing it via npm if you're using a package manager like npm or yarn.

```
npm install --save @emailjs/browser
```

or

```
$ yarn add @emailjs/browser
```

4. In your EmailJS dashboard, navigate to the "API Keys" section and copy your API key.
5. Add this code snippet before your closing tags. Making sure you have added your public key.

```js
<script type="text/javascript"
        src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@emailjs/browser@4/dist/email.min.js">
</script>
<script type="text/javascript">
  (function(){
      emailjs.init({
        publicKey: "YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY",
      });
  })();
</script>
```

6.  Create an email template in your EmailJS dashboard. This template will define the content and structure of the emails you'll send.
7. Write JavaScript function to send email using EmailJS. Below is a basic syntax for the code: 

```
emailjs.send(serviceID, templateID, templateParams, options);
```

8. Call your function whenever you want to send an email.

### Obtaining EmbedMaps API 

1. Create a Google Cloud Platform account at [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/?hl=en)
2. Set up a new project in the Google Cloud Console.
3. Enable the required Google Maps APIs from the “API & Services” dashboard.
4. Create API credentials and generate an API key and enable 'Embed Maps API'
5. Optionally restrict the API key for security under “Application restrictions” and “API restrictions.”
6. Set up billing in the Google Cloud Console.
7. Set up your API Key in your env.py
```python

os.eviron.get("MAPS_API", "user's own value")

```
8. Integrate it into your Flask app:
```python

parameters = address

maps_api = os.environ.get('MAPS_API')

embed_url = f"https://www.google.com/maps/embed/v1/place?key={maps_api}&q={parameters}"

```
9. If deployed to Heroku, Add the API key to the config vars

### Obtaining Cloudinary API
1. Sign Up at Cloudinary and verify your email.
2. Log In to your Cloudinary account.
3. Find Your API Credentials in the dashboard (Cloud name, API Key, and API Secret).
4. Install the Cloudinary Python SDK
```sh
pip3 install cloudinary
```
5. Add your Cloudinary API key to your env.py
```python
import os 

os.environ.setdefault("CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("CLOUDINARY_API_KEY", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET", "user's own value")


```

6. Configure Cloudinary in your Python application:
```python
import os
import cloudinary 

cloudinary.config(
    cloud_name = os.environ.get('CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME'),
    api_key = os.environ.get('CLOUDINARY_API_KEY'),
    api_secret = os.environ.get('CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET')
)
```
7. Integrate it with your flask app
```python
file = request.files["file"]

# Upload to cloudinary
file_upload = cloudinary.uploader.upload(file)

```

### Local Deployment

This project can be cloned or forked in order to make a local copy on your own system.

For either method, you will need to install any applicable packages found within the *requirements.txt* file.

- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.

You will need to create a new file called `env.py` at the root-level,
and include the same environment variables listed above from the Heroku deployment steps, plus a few extras.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This is a sample only; you would replace the values with your own if cloning/forking my repository.

Sample `env.py` file:

```python
import os

os.environ.setdefault("IP", "0.0.0.0")
os.environ.setdefault("PORT", "5000")
os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "user's own value")
# Mongo
os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_DBNAME", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_URI", "user's own value")
# env credentials for cloudinary API
os.environ.setdefault("CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("CLOUDINARY_API_KEY", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET", "user's own value")
# env credentials for google API
os.environ.setdefault('MAPS_API',"user's own value")
# env credentials for emailjs API
os.environ.setdefault('EMAIL_API', "user's own value")
# local environment only (do not include these in production/deployment!)
os.environ.setdefault("DEBUG", "True")
os.environ.setdefault("DEVELOPMENT", "True")
```
